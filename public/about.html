<font face="arial" size="+1">How this site came to be</font><br>
<font face="verdana" size="-1">
When I was in <a href="http://www.act-sf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=conservatory_mfa" target="_blank">grad school</a> from '95 to '97, I went searching for a site like this because the idea of such a site seemed more efficient to me than spending a few hours with the complete works on my lap. I found no such site, so after graduation, I built it.
<p>
During school, I found a list of monologues in the library at  <a href="http://www.act-sf.org/site/PageServer?pagename=conservatory_mfa" target="_blank">A.C.T.</a> which were left on the reference shelves by a fellow Alumnus.
<p>
Then I found the Complete Works of Shakespeare Online. I typed up the list from the shelves of the A.C.T. library and converted it to html, inserting links to each particular Play/Act/Scene.
<p>
I later (much later, and with some help from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=644676424" target="_blank">Aimée Bruneau</a>) completed the index to include every piece of text viable for audition, performance, classwork and/or workshop. 
<p>
In March of 2006 I was contacted by <a href="http://www.teequillin.com/" target="_blank">Tee Quillin</a> of <a href="http://www.inexplicabledumbshow.com/" target="_blank">The Inexplicable Dumb Show</a> (formerly "Mirror Up To Nature") with an offer of partnership between our sites. Tee provided the addition of PDFs of each monologue for easy printing. The PDfs are double-spaced for scansion and transcription.
<p>
In March of 2010 my old friend  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/brandon.faloona" target="_blank">Brandon Faloona</a> offerred to greatly improve this site with his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_rails" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> skills.  This incredibly kind offer led to the great search functionality and the ability to display and hide monologues within the page.  A fun bit of trivia: Brandon and I first met in 1986 while working on a college production of Hamlet. The first production of a Shakespeare play either of us ever performed in.
