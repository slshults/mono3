          M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
      yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
      every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
      here follows prose.<br>
      <i>[Reads]</i><br>
      'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
      am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
      are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
      have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
      their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
      and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
      cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
      opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
      thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
      the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
      that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
      yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
      cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
      made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
      thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
      not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
      She that would alter services with thee,
      THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'<br>
      Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
      open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
      I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross 
      acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
      I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
      me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
      loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
      late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
      and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
      with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
      of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
      be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
      cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting 
      on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
      postscript.<br>
      <i>[Reads]</i><br>
      'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
      entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling; 
      thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
      presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
      Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
      everything that thou wilt have me. <br><br>
