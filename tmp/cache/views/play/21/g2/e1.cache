And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!<br>
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,<br>
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,<br>

Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,<br>
The flat unraised spirits that have dared <br>
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth<br>
So great an object: can this cockpit hold<br>
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram<br>
Within this wooden O the very casques<br>
That did affright the air at Agincourt? <br>
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may<br>
Attest in little place a million;<br>
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,<br>
On your imaginary forces work.<br>
Suppose within the girdle of these walls<br>
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,<br>
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts<br>
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:<br>
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;<br>
Into a thousand parts divide on man, <br>
And make imaginary puissance;<br>
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them<br>
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;<br>
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,<br>
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times, <br>
Turning the accomplishment of many years<br>
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,<br>
Admit me Chorus to this history;<br>
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,<br>
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies: <br>
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought<br>
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:<br>
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,<br>
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,<br>
With winged heels, as English Mercuries. <br>
For now sits Expectation in the air,<br>
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point<br>
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,<br>
Promised to Harry and his followers.<br>
The French, advised by good intelligence <br>
Of this most dreadful preparation,<br>
Shake in their fear and with pale policy<br>
Seek to divert the English purposes.<br>
O England! model to thy inward greatness,<br>
Like little body with a mighty heart, <br>
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,<br>
Were all thy children kind and natural!<br>
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out<br>
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills<br>
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men, <br>
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,<br>
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,<br>
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,<br>
Have, for the gilt of France,—O guilt indeed!<br>
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France; <br>
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,<br>
If hell and treason hold their promises,<br>
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.<br>
Linger your patience on; and we'll digest<br>
The abuse of distance; force a play: <br>
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;<br>
The king is set from London; and the scene<br>
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;<br>
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:<br>
And thence to France shall we convey you safe, <br>
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas<br>
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,<br>
We'll not offend one stomach with our play.<br>
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,<br>
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

In motion of no less celerity<br>
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen <br>
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier<br>
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet<br>
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:<br>
Play with your fancies, and in them behold<br>
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing; <br>
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give<br>
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,<br>
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,<br>
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,<br>
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think <br>
You stand upon the ravage and behold<br>
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;<br>
For so appears this fleet majestical,<br>
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:<br>
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy, <br>
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,<br>
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,<br>
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;<br>
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd<br>
With one appearing hair, that will not follow<br>
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?<br>
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;<br>
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,<br>
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.<br>
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back; <br>
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him<br>
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,<br>
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.<br>
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner<br>
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches, <br>
<i>[Alarum, and chambers go off]</i><br>
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,<br>
And eke out our performance with your mind.

          Now entertain conjecture of a time<br>
When creeping murmur and the poring dark<br>
Fills the wide vessel of the universe. <br>
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night<br>
The hum of either army stilly sounds,<br>
That the fixed sentinels almost receive<br>
The secret whispers of each other's watch:<br>
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames <br>
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;<br>
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs<br>
Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents<br>
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,<br>
With busy hammers closing rivets up, <br>
Give dreadful note of preparation:<br>
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,<br>
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.<br>
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,<br>
The confident and over-lusty French <br>
Do the low-rated English play at dice;<br>
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night<br>
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp<br>
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,<br>
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires <br>
Sit patiently and inly ruminate<br>
The morning's danger, and their gesture sad<br>
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats<br>
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon<br>
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold <br>
The royal captain of this ruin'd band<br>
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,<br>
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'<br>
For forth he goes and visits all his host.<br>
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile <br>
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.<br>
Upon his royal face there is no note<br>
How dread an army hath enrounded him;<br>
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour<br>
Unto the weary and all-watched night, <br>
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint<br>
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;<br>
That every wretch, pining and pale before,<br>
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:<br>
A largess universal like the sun <br>
His liberal eye doth give to every one,<br>
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,<br>
Behold, as may unworthiness define,<br>
A little touch of Harry in the night.<br>
And so our scene must to the battle fly; <br>
Where—O for pity!—we shall much disgrace<br>
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,<br>
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,<br>
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,<br>
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

Be here presented. Now we bear the king<br>
Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen, <br>
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts<br>
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach<br>
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,<br>
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,<br>
Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king <br>

So swift a pace hath thought that even now<br>
You may imagine him upon Blackheath;<br>
Where that his lords desire him to have borne <br>
His bruised helmet and his bended sword<br>
Before him through the city: he forbids it,<br>
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;<br>
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent<br>
Quite from himself to God. But now behold, <br>
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,<br>
How London doth pour out her citizens!<br>
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,<br>
Like to the senators of the antique Rome,<br>
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,<br>
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:<br>
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,<br>
Were now the general of our gracious empress,<br>
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,<br>
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword, <br>
How many would the peaceful city quit,<br>
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,<br>
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;<br>
As yet the lamentation of the French<br>
Invites the King of England's stay at home; <br>
The emperor's coming in behalf of France,<br>
To order peace between them; and omit<br>
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,<br>
Till Harry's back-return again to France:<br>
There must we bring him; and myself have play'd <br>
The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.<br>
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,<br>
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
