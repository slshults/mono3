Have you not made an universal shout,<br>
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,<br>
To hear the replication of your sounds<br>
Made in her concave shores?<br>
And do you now put on your best attire?<br>
And do you now cull out a holiday?<br>
And do you now strew flowers in his way<br>
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!<br>
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,<br>
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<br>
That needs must light on this ingratitude.

I cannot tell what you and other men<br>

In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br>
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:<br>
We both have fed as well, and we can both<br>
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:<br>
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<br>
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<br>
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now<br>
Leap in with me into this angry flood,<br>
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,<br>
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in <br>
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.<br>
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it<br>
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<br>
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;<br>
But ere we could arrive the point proposed, <br>
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'<br>
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<br>
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<br>
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br>
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man <br>
Is now become a god, and Cassius is<br>
A wretched creature and must bend his body,<br>
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br>
He had a fever when he was in Spain,<br>
And when the fit was on him, I did mark <br>
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;<br>
His coward lips did from their colour fly,<br>
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br>
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:<br>
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans <br>
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<br>
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Tintinius,'<br>
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me<br>
A man of such a feeble temper should<br>
So get the start of the majestic world <br>
And bear the palm alone.

          I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crown;â€”yet 'twas not a crown
neither, 'twas one of these coronets;â€”and, as I told
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.

 I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds<br>
 Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen<br>
 The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,<br>
 To be exalted with the threatening clouds:<br>
 But never till to-night, never till now,<br>

<b>Casca.</b> A common slaveâ€”you know him well by sightâ€”<br>
 Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn<br>
 Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,<br>
 Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.<br>
 Besidesâ€”I ha' not since put up my swordâ€” <br>
 Against the Capitol I met a lion,<br>
 Who glared upon me, and went surly by,<br>
 Without annoying me: and there were drawn<br>
 Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,<br>
 Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw <br>
 Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.<br>
 And yesterday the bird of night did sit<br>
 Even at noon-day upon the market-place,<br>
 Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies<br>
 Do so conjointly meet, let not men say <br>
 'These are their reasons; they are natural;'<br>
 For, I believe, they are portentous things<br>

The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, <br>
What need we any spur but our own cause,<br>
To prick us to redress? what other bond<br>
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,<br>
And will not palter? and what other oath<br>
Than honesty to honesty engaged, <br>
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?<br>
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,<br>
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls<br>
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear<br>
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain <br>
The even virtue of our enterprise,<br>
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,<br>
To think that or our cause or our performance<br>
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood<br>
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, <br>
Is guilty of a several bastardy,<br>
If he do break the smallest particle<br>
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.

 cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
 for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
 you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
 awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
 If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
 Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
 was no less than his. If then that friend demand
 why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
 â€”Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
 Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
 die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
 all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
 as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
 valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I 
 slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
 fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
 ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
 bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
 Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
 any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
 vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
 for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. <br>
<br>
<del><b>All.</b> None, Brutus, none. <br></del>
<br>
<b>Brutus.</b> Then none have I offended. I have done no more to 
 Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
 extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
 enforced, for which he suffered death.
<i> [Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body] </i>
 Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
 though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
 the benefit of his dying, a place in the
 commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
 I depart,â€”that, as I slew my best lover for the 
 good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
 when it shall please my country to need my death.

The evil that men do lives after them;<br>

And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
He hath brought many captives home to Rome<br>

Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, <br>
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br>
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>
But here I am to speak what I do know. <br>
You all did love him once, not without cause:<br>
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<br>
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br>
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, <br>
And I must pause till it come back to me.

For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, <br>
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br>
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;<br>
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<br>
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,<br>
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus, <br>
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br>
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue<br>
In every wound of Caesar that should move<br>
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

          You have done that you should be sorry for. <br>
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br>
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty<br>
That they pass by me as the idle wind,<br>
Which I respect not. I did send to you<br>
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:<br>
For I can raise no money by vile means:<br>
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,<br>
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring<br>
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<br>
By any indirection: I did send <br>
To you for gold to pay my legions,<br>
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?<br>
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?<br>
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,<br>
To lock such rascal counters from his friends, <br>
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;<br>
Dash him to pieces!

 This is my birth-day; as this very day<br>
 Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:<br>
 Be thou my witness that against my will,<br>
 As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set<br>
 Upon one battle all our liberties.<br>
 You know that I held Epicurus strong<br>
 And his opinion: now I change my mind,<br>
 And partly credit things that do presage.<br>
 Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign<br>
 Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,<br>
 Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;<br>
 Who to Philippi here consorted us:<br>
 This morning are they fled away and gone;<br>
 And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,<br>
 Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,<br>
 As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem<br>
 A canopy most fatal, under which<br>
 Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.<br>
<br>
<del><b>Messala.</b> Believe not so.<br>
<br>
<b>Cassius.</b>I but believe it partly;<br>
 For I am fresh of spirit and resolved<br>
 To meet all perils very constantly. <br>
<br>
<b>Brutus.</b> Even so, Lucilius. </del><br>
<br>
<b>Cassius.</b> Now, most noble Brutus,<br>
 The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,<br>
 Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!<br>
 But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,<br>
 Let's reason with the worst that may befall. <br>
 If we do lose this battle, then is this<br>
 The very last time we shall speak together:<br>
 What are you then determined to do?

Hoping it was but an effect of humour,<br>

It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,<br>

Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
